                <img src="python.jpg" class="image" alt="python">

                <p><b>What is Python? Executive Summary</b><br>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented,
                    high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures,
                    combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application
                    Development,
                    as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.
                    <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">Python's simple,
                        easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program
                        maintenance.
                        Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The
                        Python interpreter and the extensive
                        standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms,
                        and can be freely distributed. <br><br> Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of
                        the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug
                        cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause
                        a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception.
                        When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source
                        level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary
                        expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The
                        debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other
                        hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source:
                        the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective. </span><br>
                    <b>Applications</b> <br>The Python Package Index (PyPI) hosts thousands of third-party modules for
                    Python. Both Python's standard library and the community-contributed modules allow for endless
                    possibilities. <br> <a href="https://www.python.org/about/apps/#web-and-internet-development">Web

                <h2 class="title">About Java</h2>
                <img src="java.jpg" class="image" alt="java">

                <p><b>What Is Java?</b><br> <br>
                    Java is a computer programming language. It enables programmers to write computer instructions using
                    English-based commands instead of having to write in numeric codes. Its known as a high-level
                    language because it can be read and written easily by humans.
                    <br><br>
                    Like English, Java has a set of rules that determine how the instructions are written. These rules
                    are known as its syntax. Once a program has been written, the high-level instructions are translated
                    into numeric codes that computers can understand and execute.
                    <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">Ease of Use: The fundamentals of Java came from a
                        programming language called C++. Although C++ is a powerful language, it is complex in its
                        syntax and inadequate for some of Java's requirements. Java built on and improved the ideas of
                        C++ to provide a programming language that was powerful and simple to use.
                        Reliability: Java needed to reduce the likelihood of fatal errors from programmer mistakes. With
                        this in mind, object-oriented programming was introduced. When data and its manipulation were
                        packaged together in one place, Java was robust.
                        Security: Because Java was originally targeting mobile devices that would be exchanging data
                        over networks, it was built to include a high level of security. Java is probably the most
                        secure programming language to date.</span>
                    Platform Independence: Programs need to work regardless of the machines they're being executed
                    on. Java was written to be a portable and cross-platform language that doesn't care about the
                    operating system, hardware, or devices that it's running on.

                    The team at Sun Microsystems was successful in combining these key principles, and Java's
                    popularity can be traced to it being a robust, secure, easy to use, and portable programming
                    language.

                <img src="c++.jpg" class="image" alt="C++">

                <p><b>What is C++?</b><br><br>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create
                    high-performance applications.

                    <br> C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

                    <br> C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

                    <br> The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17,
                    C++20. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> <br><br> <b>Why Use C++</b> </span> <br> C++ is one of
                    the world's most popular programming languages.

                   <br> C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.

                   <br> C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows
                    code to be reused, lowering development costs.

                   <br> C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

                   <br> C++ is fun and easy to learn!

                   <br> As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.
